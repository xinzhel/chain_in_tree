We now verify whether all three roots of the original cubic are real when $ a = 3 $. \n\nWe substitute $ a = 3 $ into the polynomial:\n$$\nf(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1.\n$$\nThis is the expansion of $ (x+1)^3 $. Hence, the roots of the polynomial are all real and equal to $ -1 $.\n\nThus, when $ a = 3 $, the polynomial has a triple real root $ x = -1 $. This confirms that all roots are real. Since $ a = 3 $ is the minimum value for which the derivative has real roots and the original polynomial has three real roots, this is the smallest possible value of $ a $.\n\nNow we can answer the question: The answer is 3.", "is_continuous": true, "is_terminal": true, "bn_score": 1.0, "state_conf": 1.0, "fast_reward": -1}]}

Summing over $k = 0$ to $4$, we get $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} |1 - 13\\omega_k|^2 = 5 - 26\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos(\\pi(2k+1)/10) + 845$.\nStep 6: To compute the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos(\\pi(2k+1)/10)$, we note that the 10th roots of $-1$ are symmetric about the real axis. Therefore, the sum of the real parts of the roots is zero. Since $\\cos(\\pi(2k+1)/10)$ is the real part of $e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}$, we have $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos(\\pi(2k+1)/10) = 0$. Therefore, the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} |1 - 13\\omega_k|^2 = 5 + 845 = 850$.\nNow we can answer the question: The answer is 850.", "is_continuous": true, "is_terminal": true, "bn_score": 1.0, "state_conf": 1.0, "fast_reward": -1}]}
